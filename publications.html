The article addresses the question of whether international democracy
aid helps to protect presidential term limits – a commonly accepted but
increasingly challenged safeguard for democracy. According to our
analysis, democracy aid is effective in countering attempts to
circumvent term limits, thus, it contributed towards protecting
democratic standards in African and Latin American countries between
1990 and 2014. Democracy aid helps to fend off term-limit
circumventions, but it is not as effective in deterring presidents from
trying to circumvent presidential term limits. Our analysis furthermore
suggests that there is double the risk of an attempt to circumvent term
limits in Latin American than in African states. Although our results
confirm prior findings that “targeted aid” such as democracy aid makes a
difference for maintaining democratic institutions, it challenges
studies that argue democracy assistance has become “tame.” Our findings
furthermore support previous indications that more refined theories on
the effects of democracy aid in different phases of domestic processes
are necessary, in particular in the face of global autocratization
trends.

This article analyses the conditions under which international democracy
support contributes to protecting presidential term limits. As
autocratisation has become an unwelcome global trend, researchers turned
to the study of the toolboxes of would-be autocrats, including their
attempts to circumvent term limits. Through a paired comparison of
failed attempts in Malawi (2002) and Senegal (2012), we find that
external democracy support can assist domestic actors and institutions
in deflecting challenges to term limits. We offer a novel qualitative
analysis that posits that international democracy support can only be
effective if sustained by popular democratic attitudes and behaviours of
actors in the recipient state. On the one hand, a mix of conditioning
relations with the incumbent government while capacitating
pro-democratic opposition is a successful strategy in aid-dependent
political regimes with a minimum democratic quality. On the other,
societal attitudes factor into decision-making at domestic and
international levels. Our results suggest that popular pro-democratic
attitudes encouraged international democracy support during critical
junctures in the two countries, i.e. when incumbents attempted to
circumvent term limitation. Donor investments had positive results when
donors had directed resources towards building up civil society
organisations long before any attempts at circumventing term limits were
made

Attempts to circumvent presidential term limits in African countries
show a puzzling variation of success or failure. This variation is due
to both international and domestic factors. However, how these interact
is not yet well understood. This article analyses how international
donors and organisations intervened in the attempted term limit
circumvention in Malawi from 1999 to 2003. It differentiates between
different types of instruments used by donors in democracy promotion,
and, by doing so, contributes to the question whether donors in term
limit struggles can contribute to genuine democratic consolidation. It
employs deductive process-tracing based on an analysis of primary media
sources and interviews conducted during field research. The results show
that erosion of party support as a proximate and a strong civil society
response as a mediate factor were important in saving Malawi’s term
limit. Aid conditionality and democracy promotion by donors and
international organisations exerted influence on both factors.

Social cohesion is key for sustainable development. While social
cohesion has suffered in many societies from the consequences of the
Covid-19 pandemic, high levels of social cohesion have helped to
overcome critical situations during the pandemic in other societies. As
a consequence, protecting and strengthening social cohesion has become
an increasingly central goal for most countries and the international
community. Despite the strong interest in the topic, the questions of
how to define social cohesion and make it an observable phenomenon
through proper measurement are still contested, in both academia and
policy circles. To date, no consistent, temporally and geographically
spread-out data on the different elements of social cohesion exists that
would allow for a global analysis of social cohesion. This rather
fragmented picture of analytical approaches calls for a more universal
definition and measurement of social cohesion. This paper aims to
provide a narrow and measurable definition of social cohesion that
travels across regions and countries. Conceptually, it proposes a
definition of social cohesion that incorporates the core elements of
existing and widely used definitions of social cohesion across
disciplines (trust, identity, cooperation for the common good). Our
contribution is to offer a definition of social cohesion that is broad
enough to cover the essentials holding societies together while at the
same time keeping it lean enough to analyse the causes and consequences
of social cohesion, for instance the relationship between social
cohesion and inequalities or political institutions. Methodologically,
we propose an application of our concept to the African context. It is
not only a first step towards a more global and inter-regional
measurement of social cohesion, but also the basis for further
knowledge-creation, the identification of patterns of social cohesion
and the analysis of its causes and consequences. From a policy-oriented
perspective, a more unified definition of the core elements of social
cohesion and its measurement can inform policies that aim at protecting
and fostering social cohesion. In development cooperation, it will help
not only to build indicators for designing programme objectives and for
evaluation and monitoring, but also to advance evidence-based theories
of change.

Shared values are deemed necessary as a solid foundation for social
cohesion by commentators and observers in many countries. However, when
examining what kind of values this is based on, answers often come down
to platitudes and national clichés. This discussion paper offers some
clarification through both a theoretical explication and an empirical
exploration concerning the general role of values for social cohesion.
Values are notions about desirable, trans-situational end-states and
behaviours. They fall into two categories, individual and societal
values. We provide a critical discussion of the most prominent
conceptualisations and their operationalisation in the social sciences.
Values affect social cohesion in three possible pathways: First, when
they are shared; second, when they promote behaviour per se conducive to
social cohesion and third, through their effect on policy choice and
institutional design. We review evidence provided by the research
literature for each of these pathways. We further explore the third
pathway by deriving from the research literature the conjecture that a
cultural value emphasis on egalitarianism makes a universalistic scope
of welfare institutions more likely, which in turn increases social and
political trust. We first examine this conjecture with a series of
regression models, and then run a mediation analysis. The results show
that (1.) egalitarian values are moderately strongly and positively
linked to universalistic welfare institutions, but that (2.) welfare
institutions mediate the association of egalitarian values with social
trust only to a small extent and that (3.) more universalistic welfare
institutions counteract a negative association between egalitarian
values and institutional trust.

This Discussion Paper is part of the larger research project “What is
Democracy’s Value? The Influence of Values on the Effectiveness of
Democracy Promotion”, which aims at understanding how societal values
and attitudes influence the effectiveness of international democracy
promotion in African countries. The project looks at how social values
and political attitudes mediate the promotion of democracy in two
specific realms: attempts by heads of state to circumvent presidential
term limits; and reforms to legislation in the realm of family law and
LGBTI (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transsexual, Intersex) rights. This
Discussion Paper focuses on two cases situated in Malawi: the attempt of
former president Bakili Muluzi to alter presidential term limits in
Malawi in 2002; and the reform of Malawi’s family and marriage law in
2015. In both cases, donors engaged in democracy promotion in different
ways and to different degrees. In the former case, donor countries and
organisations warned the Muluzi government to heed the democratic
process and thereby seconded popular attitudes. In the latter, donor
countries and organisations played an important role in coordinating and
mobilising domestic actors towards the reform of Malawi’s family and
marriage law.

The end of the Cold War saw an unprecedented diffusion of democracy.
This diffusion went hand in hand with the emergence of international
democracy promotion. Through democracy promotion, democratic states
attempt to support and protect democratic institutions around the world
by means of bilateral and multilateral international cooperation as well
as development cooperation. Yet, the ‘wave of democratization’ has ebbed
away since the Cold War. Rather than an anabated spread of democracy,
many countries that seemed on a transition-path to democracy are now
stuck in a political state between autocracy and democracy, where
democratic institutions formally exist but are compromised by
authoritarian practices. Moreover, populist movements, illiberalism, and
non-democratic institutional changes seem to challenge democracy as a
political system even in countries where it was long since regarded as
historically and socially consolidated. This as well as the increasing
confidence of authoritarian regimes threaten to jeopardize the strides
that worldwide democratization has made in the past three decades.
Against this setting, the present thesis investigates the effectiveness
of international democracy promotion in supporting and guarding the
democratic institutionalization of political power. The research
presented here zooms in on presidential term limits, a political
institution meant to prevent the personalization of political power and
ensure rotation in presidential office. While it was characteristic for
countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, that began transitioning
to democracy at the end of the Cold War to introduce presidential term
limits in their newly designed constitutions, many of these provisions
have since been challenged by incumbent presidents. Research shows that
the evasion of term limits is associated with a worsening of the general
state of democracy in a country. Evasion of presidential term limits is
thus seen as an important manifestation for the weak
institutionalization and further de-institutionalization of democracy.
Although presidential term limits and in particular their circumvention
have hence become a subject matter of interest to political scientists,
many scholars do not focus in this regard explicitly on the role of
international democracy support. I address this gap by studying the
influence that international democracy promotion has on the evasion and
introduction of presidential term limits. The first chapter provides a
conceptual and theoretical introduction to presidential term limits and
their relation to the weak institutionalization of democracy. Democracy
promotion and the different forms it may take is also introduced before
a brief outlook on the thesis is presented. In chapter two my co-author
and I present a broad perspective on how democracy aid, which is the
implementation of democracy promotion as foreign aid in development
cooperation, is associated with the risk that presidents attempt to
evade term limits as well as that they actually succeed in doing so. In
chapter three, my co-author and I undertake a qualitative paired
comparison of two cases where incumbent presidents attempted to
circumvent a term limit but failed at different stages during the
process. We compare the role that different means, or ‘instruments’ of
democracy promotion played in both cases and how their effectiveness was
predicated on favourable domestic conditions, particularly popular
pro-democratic attitudes. In chapter four, I provide an ‘in-depth’
description of one of the two cases. The chapter employs a qualitative
methodology designed to trace closely the influence of different factors
for an outcome. I make use of this by systematically assessing how
different democracy promotion instruments acted alone and in conjunction
with domestic factors on the case’s outcome. Finally, chapter five
shifts the focus from the evasion of term limits to the introduction of
term limits. Interested in the ‘on-the-ground’ practice of democracy
promotion during ad hoc emerging reform episodes, I study the
interactions between on the one hand domestic civil society and
political opposition parties and on the other hand external embassies
and international organizations. The research results show that
international democracy promotion often has a limited, conditional
influence on preventing the de-institutionalization of democracy. While
it is evident according to a presented statistical analysis that
democracy promotion through foreign aid is associated with lower risks
of term limit evasions, this relation is substantial in effect size only
for medium to high -amounts of democracy aid. Furthermore, results of
the qualitative case studies show that democracy promotion operates
through largely two mechanisms, a ‘hard power’ mechanism functioning
according to a logic of consequentiality, conditionality, and leverage;
and a ‘soft power’ mechanism functioning according to a logic of
appropriateness and linkage. However, both work best in tandem, and are
predicated on domestic conditions, particularly on favourable popular
(pro-)democratic attitudes and a civil society that is free to mobilize.
Finally, the research presented here also emphasizes the quandaries to
which democracy promoters themselves are subject, especially when they
need to respond ad hoc to a push for political liberalization in an
hitherto (semi-)authoritarian country context. The thesis contributes to
two interescting research fields, one on the evasion of presidential
term limits, and the other on the role that international democracy
support can play in preserving and promoting democratic institutions.
Its results suggest policy implications particularly for the practice
and implementation of democracy promotion. Foremost among these are that
the level of spending of democracy aid in development cooperation as
well as its temporal continuation can have substantial effects on
guarding democratic institutions (chapter two); that ‘hard power’ and
‘soft power’ approaches of democracy promotion need to be used wisely in
complementarity to one another (chapter three and four); that foreign
states and international organizations need to react decisively against
the curbing of the civic space, and also need to defend institutions
integral to ‘democracy as democracy’ against transgressions and
violations (chapters three to five); and finally, that democracy
supporters, particularly foreign governments as democracy supporters,
need to critically reflect on self-imposed internal restraints besides
encountered external constraints in the practice of international
democracy promotion.
